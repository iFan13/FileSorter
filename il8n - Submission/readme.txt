If you have python installed, double click FileSorteril8n.pyw and it should run automatically.
If you do not have python installed, https://www.python.org/downloads/ will have the latest versions available for download.
If you wish to view with a console, change the file type from .pyw to .py
Please keep files together as I was not able to compile into a full on .exe file. 

The program is set to detect your machine's language and translate if I have the available translations. (I used es_MX and fr_CA - I proofed my translations with a friend from Venezuela and bilingual friend but translations may not still be perfect) Language will default to en_US otherwise.

Follow the instructions on the GUI. A sample directory has been provided. It is recommended to make a copy of the sample directory for trying the sort multiple times or navigate to which folders to sort and re-instate where files are to be located. 
Default sort will sort all the files in the targetted directory to self-created folders within the targetted directory.
Custom sort gives you more control allowing you to select what type of files denoted are to be located in chosen directories. Directories may also be typed in (ill-advised for general user use hence the [...] buttons in custom sort screen). 

To view the code, open the .py/.pyw file in an IDE or text editor (I used notepad++).


Persona 1
Riley is a University freshman. Riley is fairly tech savvy, and while diligent with his studies, Riley
participates many extra curricular activities and social circles. As a result he receives an
overwhelming amount of attachments for both social and academic purposes. Due to his busy
schedule, Riley is not diligent in organizing his downloaded files and often downloads
duplicates. This creates a lot of bulk on his computer. Riley opts to bulk delete his downloads
when they reach a certain limit.

Scenario 1
Riley decides to organize.
Riley has accidentally deleted an assignment and was forced to redo the assignment taking
time away from his already busy schedule. While he understands the importance of sorting his
attachments and downloads, he simply does not have the time to dedicate to sorting old files.
Riley recognizes that if he could automate his sorting, he could adopt a regularly scheduled
sorting rather than leaving to when his folder becomes too bulky. Riley discovers a file sorting
application that can perform simple sorting, such as by file type, and file name sorting allowing
some more control and customizing sorting.

Persona 2 - Marin
Marin is a retired grandmother. While she has ample time, she is not very familiar with how
computers work. When sent attachments such as photos and videos by her children and
grandchildren, she often re-downloads automatically the attachment rather than opening the
existing file. She is also using the default download parameters placing everything in a generic
download folder.

Scenario 2
Marin’s daughter has discovered Marin’s habit of redownloading attachments when she wants
to view them. Marin’s daughter and explains to Marin why and how to view the files without
redownloading. However, the sheer volume of files is now daunting to sift through manually.
Marin’s daughter suggests a full deletion and individual redownload but Marin understandably
says she cannot remember what or where every downloaded file/attachment could come from.
Marin and her daughter want to find software to help them sort through and clear potential
duplicates. They discover a file sorting application that features the ability to clear duplicates*
and sort files for future simplicity of sorting for Marin when she is without her daughter beside
her.



*by moving to recycle bin. It is possible to target the recycle bin by the address C:\$Recycle.Bin but is still limited to the file extension sorting. I would make improvements to the program by adding in a name field in custom to allow for "contains name" sorting.
